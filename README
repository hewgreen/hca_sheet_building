Old code is obsoleted in ops (archive directory)

make_dev_full_latest.py

Outputs full yams and full sheet from dev latest. If new types are created these will need to be manually added.

Uses ingest-client locally I used `pip3 install -e ~/Google\ Drive/ingest-client/` this is install in the dev mode. Go to /Users/hewgreen/Google Drive/ingest-client and pull for latest build before using these scripts. Note that this could be pip installed when ingest-cli is fixed.

Working now `pip freeze` gives

hca==3.4.5
hca-cli==0.1.0
